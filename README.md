## Pirated Games

**Here is a list of Pirated Game Sites!**

A list of tools, sites, downloads, software, etc. for Pirated Games. I maintain this by myself with the help with some others like Tasky Lizard and Le Fishe. It is updated constantly if I need to update something, or remove something. I also add stuff as well every now and then if I discover something sweet.

Other noteworthy mentions:

- [1337X](https://1337x.to/) - Has lots of content, well moderated. Before going there though, don't torrent from IGGGAMESCOM, haxNode, nosTeam, crackingpatching, or CracksHash as they are suspicious users and had uploaded malware in the past.

## **Paid Games that don't require a Pirated Version to play!**

These games normally have community remakes, source ports, alternative versions, etc.

- [Plutonium](https://plutonium.pw) - Free, Community made remaster of Call of Duty: Black Ops 2, Modern Warfare 3, and World at War. Provides a little bit of a fresh new experience, fixes problems with the original games, and is very good. Provides server lists, dedicated servers, online gameplay, and customizabale options for your gameplay.
- [OpenRA](https://www.openra.net/) - Free, Open-Source, and community made remaster of Command & Conquer: Tiberian Daw, Red Alert 1, and DUNE 2000. Its pretty good and feels a bit like the original game with fixes, refreshment, better graphics, etc. Their official website provides more details.
- [PowerSlaveEX](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VFvOYKyjyFwH5sqSL5mz_jl3SdIUcAOY/view) - PowerSlaveEX was a free and open-source, PowerSlave Playstation Version source-port/remaster for PC which was taken down years ago. I only have the Windows Version of this game available including the mouse moving fix patch (Without this patch, it would make the game completely unplayable). In this game, you play as a marine fighting against the evil, Alien forces in Karnak, Egypt that killed the people there and turned them into egyption themed mosters like Anubis Headed Men, Mummies, Leopard Monsters, etc. There are an assortment of weapons from a Machete, Revolver, M60, a FlameThrower, Grenades, Homing Snake Rockets, etc. Another thing about this game is that there are powerups that give you special abilities and cool stats. If you want info about this awesome FPS game that was probably as good as DOOM, watch Br0leg's YouTube video about it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyXDWWzMvXw.

## **Direct Download Sites:**
**Best site overall: [CS.RIN.RU - Steam Underground Community](https://cs.rin.ru/forum/)** - Best place for any game, this should be the first place you check. Does not allow Scene releases.

- [Ovagames](http://www.ovagames.com/) - DDL Games.
- [RLSBB](https://rlsbb.ru/) - DDL Scene Releases.

Oculus Quest users can download games from [this thread](https://cs.rin.ru/forum/viewtopic.php?f=38&t=103122) on [CS.RIN.RU](http://cs.rin.ru/) forum. [This post](https://cs.rin.ru/forum/viewtopic.php?p=2077062#p2077062) is also helpful.

For a good alternative to CS.RIN.RU on VR Games is VRPirates Discord and Telegram. The Telegram is better since it has more content and provides downloads. Discord is inactive for a good amount of some days, so I would recommend the Telegram. [VRPirates Telegram](https://t.me/VRPirates) and [VRPirates Discord](https://discord.gg/D9rs7TM).

## **Useful Software:**

- [7zip File Manager](https://www.7-zip.org/) - Better than WinRAR.
- [Achievement Watcher](https://github.com/xan105/Achievement-Watcher/) - View every achievement earned on your PC whether it's coming from Steam, a Steam emulator, and more.

- [Cyberduck](https://cyberduck.io) - Manage your Cloud Services and copy files to other places. Free and open-source, alternative to AirExplorer.
- [AirExplorer](https://airexplorer.net) - Is just like Cyberduck but can do more than it. Is proprietary and has a paid version which is good.

**Not game related, but for Microsoft Products and Adobe Products, [go to the backup of r/sjain_guides.](https://web.archive.org/web/20210328020828/https://www.saidit.net/s/sjain_guides)**

## **Useful Browser Extensions:**

These don't help much with online piracy, but will make your browsing much more private and safe.

- [Decentraleyes](https://decentraleyes.org) - Free Content Delivery localization to protect privacy and browsing.
- [HTTPS Everywhere](https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere) - Force HTTPS Connections on your Web Browser and be warned when a connection isn't secure.
- [Privacy Badger](https://privacybadger.org/) - Tracker Blocker for Chrome and FireFox (This is redundant and shouldn't be used with uBlock Origin, so get that instead).
- [Ublock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock) - Wide-Scale Content blocker and AdBlocker
- [Universal Bypass](https://universal-bypass.org/) - Bypass stupid and annoying Link Shorteners like bit.ly 
- [LocalCDN](https://localcdn.org) - Alternative to Decentraleyes that is kept more up-to-date with extra features and CDNs added.
- [MATE Translate](https://gikken.co/mate-translate/) - Privacy Friendly alternative to Google Translate that is better. Scroll down to the bottom of the page for web browser extension translator.

## **DNS:**

Using a privacy-focused DNS can speed up your browsing experience as well as make your network traffic more secure. They can also prevent you from your ISP snooping around on what sites you are going to and what you are doing on your web searches which is good for Piracy. (NOT a VPN substitute):

**My Choice: [Adguard DNS](https://adguard.com/en/adguard-dns/overview.html)**

More trusted DNS providers can be found [here](https://www.privacytools.io/providers/dns/).

NOTE: **I don't recommend you using CloudFare's DNS or your ISP's DNS for pirating as they can spy on what you are browsing on. You can get caught from your ISP.**

## **VPNs:**

- Recommending a VPN service is very difficult, so we'd like to point your VPN related questions towards [r/VPN](https://reddit.com/r/VPN).
- [Privacy Tools' VPN recommendations](https://www.privacytools.io/providers/vpn/)
- [VPN Comparison Chart](https://thatoneprivacysite.net/vpn-comparison-chart/)

**Tor is NOT a VPN, it will not protect you when torrenting!**
**Free VPNs aren't worth it and always find a way to make money off of you, whether its from logging, spyware, tracking, you name it! ProtonVPN and RiseUpVPN are fine, but you cannot torrent with them on the free version.**

## **Unsafe software:**

- BitTorrent - Same as uTorrent, has ads, trackers, and is unsafe.
- uTorrent - Same as BitTorrent, has ads, trackers, and is unsafe.
- BitLord - Probably the most unsafe one on the list, this has ads, trackers, is obscure, stuffed with trackers, and is unsafe.
- BitComet - Torrent Client that is adware, has trackers, and is unsafe.
- CCleaner - Owned by Avast.
- Avast - Notorious for collecting and selling user data.

## **Untrusted sites:**

- IGG Games / PC Games Torrents - they doxxed Mercs213 (owner of GoodOldDownloads), package their own DRM in indie games and exploit you for ad revenue.
- BBRepacks - Fake BlackBox Repacks, contain malware.
- OceanOfGames - High malware risk.
- nosTEAM - Malware spotted in releases
- cracked-games.org - Malware Risk.
- crackingpatching - Malware Risk
- The Pirate Bay - High Malware Risk
- Kickass Torrents - High Malware Risk
- CracksHash - Caught with malware in the past.
- Any site with a scene group name in the URL - **SCENE GROUPS DON'T HAVE SITES!**
- Seyter/Qoob - Caught with putting miners and malware in repacks. Qoob used to be called Seyter, but then changed his name.
- CorePack - Repacking group that put malware into releases. Releases are nuked now, remaining ones are fine
- Fake and Imposter websites impersonating trusted sites and other sites 
- Any website on YouTube or Google Search leading to Cracked Games or free games, many of them are suspicious and should be kept away from

**I will keep this list updated, so check back every so often!**

- Edited by Rekulous and others! ;)
